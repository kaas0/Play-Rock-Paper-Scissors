Train of thought for the creation of Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

How to Play Rock, Paper, Scissors: A Simple Guide

A quick walkthrough on the basics of rock, paper, scissors


Rock, paper, scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken) is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something, or even just an entertaining way to pass the time. The neat thing about the game is that almost anybody can pick the rules up in a matter of seconds. In this article, we’ll break the game down so that you and a friend can play whenever you’d like. (short description of the game from Wiki How)

Playing a Round

1.
Face the other player and hold your hands up at your stomach. Stand a few paces apart from your opponent. Place your nondominant hand flat out in front of you with the palm up (imagine you’re making a platform for your other hand). Set your dominant hand on top.[4]
Rock, paper, scissors is normally only played with two people, but you can play with up to 3 people if you’d like.

2.
Count “rock, paper, scissors” by tapping your hands together. Each player throws their choices out on the count of three by calling out “rock, paper, scissors.” With each word, tap your nondominant hand with your dominant fist. Each player should synchronize the count and make eye contact while they do this.
The tapping on your nondominant hand helps you and your opponent stay synchronized.
Many players will include a fourth count, “shoot,” where players throw their choice out at the same time. This is totally optional, but discuss whether you’re going on “shoot” or “scissors” ahead of time.
You can also say “ro, sham, bo” or count to three if you want.

3.
Determine the winner. After you’ve both played an object, look to see who’s won. Each object wins against one shape and loses to another. For instance, rock “crushes” scissors but is “covered” by paper, paper “covers” rock but is “cut” by scissors, and scissors is “crushed” by rock but “cuts” paper. The player who picks the stronger of the two objects is the winner.[5]
If both players throw the same object, it’s a tie. In this situation, simply play again. Continue doing this until there is a clear winner.
Many people choose to do “best of 3” or “best of 5” since rock paper scissors is such a quick and easy game to play.
If you play with more than 2 players, continue playing rounds until there’s one player left standing.

In my project we have two players, a live player and a computer player.
For the live player we will need:
1.A short walkthrough how the game is played.
2.Three clickable options for his choice
 Each choice will generate a random number from the Math random function
 Then his choice will be evaluated for truth against another random number the computer will choose.
 then the results will be promted. 
 the result will be stored in a score variable
3.a result box which will contain the score.
